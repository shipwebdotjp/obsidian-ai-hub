"""Vector Search MCP Server.

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides tools for semantic and keyword search
against a vector database of memory entries.

The server exposes one main tool:
1. search: Performs semantic and keyword search with configurable modes (hybrid, similarity-only, fulltext-only).

Both tools return document metadata and content that can be used by LLMs to provide
contextually relevant responses to user queries.
