# obsidian-ai-hub

obsidian-ai-hub is an automation toolkit for Obsidian daily-note workflows.

It helps with:
- organizing inbox items into a daily note
- generating daily and weekly summaries
- notifying you about today’s schedule and tasks
- collecting and organizing research topics
- connecting an Obsidian vault with external services

## Highlights

- Merge inbox content into a daily note
- Create daily targets and reminders
- Notify upcoming calendar events
- Back up vault data and related artifacts
- Keep secrets and public configuration separate

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create your local configuration files:
   - `cp config/config.example.yml config/config.yml`
   - `cp .env.example .env`
3. Edit `config/config.yml` to match your vault paths and backup settings.
4. Edit `.env` to set API keys, tokens, and machine-specific paths.
5. Run the test suite:
   - `pytest tests/`

### install to LaunchAgent
1. chmod +x install.sh
2. make install
3. make enable

## Configuration

Use the following split to keep the project OSS-friendly:

`.env`
- secrets
- API keys and tokens
- personal absolute paths
- environment-specific values
- `LOCAL_MODEL_DIR` is used as the base download cache for local embedder models

`config/config.yml`
- non-sensitive application settings
- relative paths and filenames inside the vault
- backup targets
- default feature values
- vault index storage paths and embedder model name

## Usage

```bash
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --merge-inbox
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --make-target
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --notify-calendar-event
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --summerize-week
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --backup
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --sync-vault
python -m obsidian_ai_hub --screenshot
```

The vault sync command indexes the full `VAULT_PATH` tree into `md-hybrid-search` and stores its SQLite/Chroma data outside the vault by default.

## Task Runner

The task runner reads scheduled jobs from `tasks/tasks.local.yml` when it exists, and falls back to `tasks/tasks.yml` otherwise. It also persists the last execution time in `tasks/last_run.json` so each task is only run once per matching schedule window.

Use `tasks/tasks.local.sample.yml` as the starting point for your own `tasks/tasks.local.yml`.

Each task entry uses this shape:

```yaml
- id: example
  enabled: true
  schedule:
    type: hourly
    minute: 0
  command: echo "hello"
```

Supported `schedule.type` values are `minutely`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly`.

`schedule` fields can be written as:
- a single number, for example `minute: 0`
- a list, for example `minute: [0, 30]`
- a comma-separated string, for example `minute: "0,30"`
- a range, for example `hour: "8-18"`
- a stepped range, for example `minute: "*/15"` or `hour: "8-18/2"`
- `*` where allowed, such as `weekday: "*"`

The runner understands `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, and `weekday`. Missing fields fall back to sensible defaults, such as `minute: 0` and `weekday: "*"`.

Commands are executed without a shell. Plain argv-style commands are supported, and you can chain a directory change with `cd /path && ...`. Shell operators like pipes, redirects, and environment expansion are not interpreted.
